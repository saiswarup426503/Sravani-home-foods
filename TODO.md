# TODO: Implement Menu Persistence for Customer Visibility

## Tasks
- [x] Add localStorage loading for menu on App mount
- [x] Add useEffect to save menu to localStorage on changes
- [x] Test menu updates persist across page refreshes
- [x] Verify customers see updated menu immediately in same session

## Notes
- Changes isolated to App.tsx
- Fallback to initialMenu if localStorage fails
- No new dependencies needed
